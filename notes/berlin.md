## Housing Network
Distributed network of apartments/living-situations
Rights to Housing, use-conditions

1) Joins the Network
2) Lists their space/apartment as an organization
3) Offer rights to use their space/apartment with use-conditions
4) Rights can be offered towards the goals of other organizations.
    ex: 
5) These rights can recieve potential value from the goals they address in various organizations.
6) Their use (completion) creates realized value.
    - Ex: A right as an offer to use it, has potential value.
            But if the right's use cannot be completed (completion phase) then the right does not create realized value. 
7) Rights use-conditions can be based on how much potential/realized value one has.
    - An org can specify the:
        - Minimum Potential Needed, given 0 Realized
        - Minimum Realized Needed, given 0 Potential
    - And a Curve can be constructed for transitioning between the two for any given right.
